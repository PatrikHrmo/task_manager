This is an assignment for my Testing course at Engeto.
This is my first app using basic Python programming and a connection to MySQL database.
The aim of this app is to provide scheduling of tasks - it saves a task and its description into a database, then it shows saved tasks, and finally it deletes them. It can change the state of a task as well.
The functions were designed to be testable.
There are some automated tests as well, both positive and negative, for the add, update and delete functions.
The old versions are stored in the /old folder.
The test report and bug report file relates to the file task_manager.py.
