This is an assignment for my Testing course at Engeto.
This is my first app using basic Python programming and a connection to MySQL database.
The aim of this app is to provide scheduling of tasks - it saves a task and its description into a database, then it shows saved tasks, and finally it deletes them.

My next goal is following:
- to create automated tests
- to create an API
